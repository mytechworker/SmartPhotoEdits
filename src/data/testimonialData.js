      "Ich bin begeistert von der Arbeit von Smart Photo Edits. Sie waren in der Lage, Störungen im Hintergrund meines Bildes zu entfernen und fliegende Haare zu bändigen. Sie haben ein ausrangiertes Foto in ein Bild verwandelt, das ich zu schätzen weiß. Frederick hat schnell reagiert und einen äußerst professionellen und zuvorkommenden Service geboten. Ich bin sehr zufrieden und würde ihre Dienste ohne zu zögern weiterempfehlen.",

      "I badly wanted to have my memories of visiting Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in central Australia recorded in a very high quality photo panorama. After researching the web, I found Landscape Panorama Photo Stitching Services. They were able to stitch my nine (9) Canon Raw photos into one very high quality panorama. Their service was very prompt and high quality. I would recommend them to anyone else needing this type of service.",

      "I had a very nice family picture and I was planning to make a poster of that picture. But there was a problem with background and to make large size poster I really need some professional editing. I tried couple of options and nothing worked. Then I found Smart Photo Edits online and I sent my picture to them. They really did a great job and gave me the picture next business day. I really appreciate their work and service. My special thanks to Mr. Pankaj for his customer service.",
