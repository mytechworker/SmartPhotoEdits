      "For years, my mother refers to a picture we took on vacation, as her favorite picture of her and I. I love it too, but it had headphones and an envelope in the picture. Wanting to find a way to remove these items from the photo I Googled picture editing and Smart Photo Edits was one of the companies that came up. I randomly choose them, basically a shot in the dark hoping they could correct my photo or refer me to someone who could. I didn’t not expect the prompt professional response I received from Prashanth Ashok. They turned a great picture into an even better one. Now its my favorite too. Framing and sending as a birthday present, my Mother will be beyond appreciatively stunned (with tears in her eyes).",

Auf der Suche nach einer Möglichkeit, diese Gegenstände aus dem Foto zu entfernen, habe ich nach Bildbearbeitung gegoogelt und Smart Photo Edits war eines der Unternehmen, die mir angezeigt wurden. Ich wählte sie zufällig aus, in der Hoffnung, dass sie mein Foto korrigieren oder mich an jemanden verweisen könnten, der das kann. Ich hatte nicht mit der prompten und professionellen Antwort gerechnet, die ich von Prashanth Ashok erhielt. Sie haben ein großartiges Bild in ein noch besseres verwandelt. Jetzt ist es auch mein Lieblingsbild. Wenn ich es rahme und als Geburtstagsgeschenk verschicke, wird meine Mutter mehr als dankbar sein (mit Tränen in den Augen).",
